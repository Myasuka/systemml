MapReduce is emerging as a generic parallel programming paradigm for large clusters of
machines. This trend combined with the growing need to run machine learning (ML) algorithms on
massive datasets has led to an increased interest in implementing ML algorithms on
MapReduce. However, the cost of implementing a large class of ML algorithms as low-level MapReduce
jobs on varying data and machine cluster sizes can be prohibitive.  In this paper, we propose
SystemML in which ML algorithms are expressed in a higher-level language and are compiled and
executed in a MapReduce environment.  This higher-level language exposes several constructs
including linear algebra primitives that constitute key building blocks for a broad class of
supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. The algorithms expressed in SystemML are compiled and
optimized into a set of MapReduce jobs that can run on a cluster of machines. We describe and
empirically evaluate a number of optimization strategies for efficiently executing these algorithms
on Hadoop, an open-source MapReduce implementation. We report an extensive performance evaluation on
three ML algorithms on varying data and cluster sizes.
