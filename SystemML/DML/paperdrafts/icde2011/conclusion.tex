In this paper we have presented SystemML - a system that enables the development of large-scale machine learning algorithms.  SystemML applies a sequence of transformations to translate DML scripts, the language in which machine learning algorithms are expressed, into highly optimized execution plans over MapReduce.  Starting with program analysis, these transformations include evaluation and selection of alternative execution plans and final assembly of lower-level operators into small number of MapReduce jobs.  Systematic empirical results in this paper have shown the benefit of a number of optimization strategies such as blocking, piggybacking and local aggregation, and the applicability of SystemML to scale-up a diverse set of machine learning algorithms. Ongoing work includes system-wide cost-based optimizations, e.g., evaluation and selection of multiple matrix blocking strategies, development of additional constructs to support machine learning meta-tasks such as model selection, and enabling a large class of algorithms to be probed at an unprecedented data scale.
